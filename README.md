# Arduino LCD over Serial Panel (alos-panel)

Here I'm creating an Arduino based replacement for [LCD over Serial Panel (LoS-Panel)](https://mlf.home.xs4all.nl/los/) for HD44780 Driver of [lcdproc](http://www.lcdproc.org/).
More information on setup of LoS-Panel for lcdproc [can be found here](http://lcdproc.sourceforge.net/docs/current-user.html#hd44780-los-panel).
This project **will** support different connections and different types of HD44780 based displays.
Main platform for this project is Arduino Uno and Nano boards but it should certainly work on another Arduino boards as well.

## Current status 
Work-In-Progress but already usable.
